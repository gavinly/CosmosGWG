2. Please indicate [your primary governance interests here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdSwln5L7KLvEkkM91GhlblniSynmAjMyAWSLONxTGQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Agenda

#### 1. Newcomer introductions
Please keep intros brief! Ideally your name, organization, primary governance interest in a single sentence :)

#### 2. GWG updates
- mid-month topic call review (Zaki's work on a legal entity)
- governance work updates
  - documentation & best practices for [community-spend](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend) & [parameter-change](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki) proposals
  - draft proposal by Sunny (All in Bits; Sikka)

#### 3. Proposed Topic: What kind of governance work could the Cosmos Hub find valuable?
- a two-step process & best practices documentation for funded dev work
- a process & best practices documentation for upgrade proposals
- a website for Cosmos governance processes & best practices documentation

Is there low-hanging fruit for outstanding governance work?

#### 4. Future planning
- What single topic is a current priority for the next mid-month call?
- Consider recommendations for GWG Q2 initiatives ie. what could a Q2 GWG community-spend proposal look like?

## Notes

### 1. New attendees
12 attendees in total, with introductions from new attendees:
- Adriana ([All in Bits](https://www.google.com)) - The power of governance as a tool for coordination
- Stamford - General interest in governance
- Seth Riney ([Staked](https://staked.us)) - Representing Staked's interests in Cosmos governance
- Felix Lutsch ([Chorus One](https://chorus.one)) - Interested in learning and improving governance theory

#### 2. GWG updates
##### Mid-month topic call review from Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network))
On [Mar 18](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosGWG#march-18) we had a short call to discuss connecting the Cosmos Hub's governance mechanism to a dedicated legal entity. Zaki (Iqlusion) led the conversation about his work to create such a legal entity, one that gives legal rights to token-holders. This legal entity could be a middle management layer between Cosmos Hub governance mechanism and those who do development work, and the legal entity would be obligated to pursue token-holder desires, as expressed through the governance mechanism. Rather than have many employees, the legal entity could have many company members.

##### Governance work updates
On [Mar 26](https://twitter.com/Ether_Gavin/status/1242631518255755276), Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network)) published v1.0 of the Cosmos Parameter-Change proposal documentation. The end-user can use these docs to understand the governable parameters and to make the proposal process easier. The GWG can use this to provide support for people drafting parameter-change proposals. Gavin is looking for feedback as people use the docs to improve upon the docs. You can read more about the documentation [here](https://figment.network/resources/cosmos-community-spend-best-practices/).

#### 3. What kind of governance work could the Cosmos Hub find valuable?
**Currently recording these notes**, will update soon.

#### 4. Future planning
Going forward, Gavin (Figment Networks) will host topic calls periodically and as needed, likely at least one per month. Gavin does not intend to seek GWG funding for Q2 2020.
