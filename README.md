### Previous topic calls

#### June 3
**Topic:** How can the Cosmos Hub can evolve as a living organism? By Chjango (Tendermint Inc)

How should we, as the community of people who govern the Hub, be thinking about driving it to become a competitive hub?

1) Newcomer intros (5 mins)
2) Quick update about latest governance proposals - Gavin (Figment Networks) (5 mins)
3) Discussion topic (remainder of time ~45 mins)

[Accompanying document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1901Y6Vbg927Ox1a1jn8NXmukME7V7rhoJsSamLKUp1I/edit?usp=sharing)

At least for now, the ATOM's value is tied to the Hub, and the Hub's value is derived from the utility it has and the liquidity that's flowing through it. Chjango (Tendermint Inc.) would like us to consider the competitive landscape and to think about what our community should be funding to drive meaningful adoption.

In this call we explored what options we have as a community and considered our future directives for the Hub and the ATOM.

00:22:36	Gavin (Figment):	So with Peggy, you can mint vouchers redeemable for assets locked up on Ethereum. Then you can use those vouchers in Cosmos ecosystem DeFi.
00:37:19	Gavin (Figment):	https://docs.google.com/document/d/17BShngBgy10Cq93DxK8gyynWx23Abghd8xRm7F8tq5w/edit?usp=sharing

00:57:26	JK:	Agreed!
00:57:27	Jazear Brooks:	agreed Justin, DeGov will be increasingly important and Cosmos Hub’s governance can lead the way.  it’s like a Dao although it hasn’t been overtly named as such
00:58:33	Henrik Aasted Sørensen:	It’s super interesting. Especially putting the smart contracts under governance is a really great idea for the hub!
01:09:25	James Moreau:	This convo is very exciting. Gotta hop off. Talk soon everyone

#### March 18
**Topic:** Connecting Cosmos Hub's governance to a dedicated legal entity

**Context:** My understanding is that Zaki (Iqlusion) is working to establish a legal entity. This entity would be dedicated to orchestrating the kind of developer work that All in Bits has done in the past for the Cosmos Hub. The dev work would be funded by the community pool via the legal entity, which would then be accountable to the Cosmos Hub. 

**Agenda:** Single-sentence intros from newcomers. Gavin (Figment) to provide brief background. Zaki intends to provide an update after a discussion with the lawyer, and we can discuss the work that should be done on the Hub side to establish a connection with the legal entity.

**Chat log:**
```
00:03:39	Gavin (Figment):	Hey Ken, are you able to hear now?
00:21:39	Gavin (Figment):	1. How do you fund work on an ongoing basis?
00:22:22	Gavin (Figment):	2. How do you incentivize people to do the managerial work? And how can that be a big opportunity for newcomers.
00:25:16	Gavin (Figment):	Documentation and best practices work funded, too (via same proposal)
00:25:19	Gavin (Figment):	https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki
00:25:23	Gavin (Figment):	https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend
00:26:42	zakimanian:	https://twitter.com/lex_node
00:26:51	Gavin (Figment):	Legal entity could be a middle management layer between Cosmos Hub governance mechanism and those who do development work.
00:29:20	Taariq Lewis:	So doesn’t this entity now be liable for the legal outcomes of the token holder’s desires?
00:31:08	Gavin (Figment):	A thing that gives legal rights to token-holders. This legal entity would be obligated to pursue their desires, as expressed through the governance mechanism. Rather than have many employees, the legal entity could have many company members.
00:32:18	Gavin (Figment):	15 mins remaining
00:41:06	Matthew Felice Pace:	How does this solve the problem of the cosmos hub deciding direction? Will direction be decided by this entity or by governance?
00:42:10	Gavin (Figment):	Hey Matthew, I think that the Hub decides direction, the entity holds accountable the participants that execute the decision.
00:42:36	Gavin (Figment):	The entity itself would be held accountable to the Hub.
00:43:29	Matthew Felice Pace:	so a middle man that distributes funds and makes sure that things are done?
00:43:31	Florian | Staking Facilities:	Have to jump onto another call, sadly. See you guys next time :wave:
00:44:07	Gavin (Figment):	Yes, I think so (Matthew). Take care, Florian, thanks for joining!
00:44:17	Stamford Hwang:	Kind of like the role of Department of Justice?
00:47:21	Gavin (Figment):	We’re at 45mins, gotta wrap it up.
00:52:24	Gavin (Figment):	Working group call afterparty, no pressure to stick around.
00:54:56	Gavin (Figment):	Add your name to this list (semi-public) and I can email you about future calls: http://bit.ly/2sukvxa
00:56:27	Ismail Khoffi:	Thanks everyone!
