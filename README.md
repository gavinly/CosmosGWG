## Cosmos GWG Community Call
Discuss [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/gwg-community-calls-updates/3238/6)

### Purpose
The Cosmos GWG Community Call is intended to bring together various Cosmos stakeholders who play major roles developing the Cosmos. It's the opportunity to connect, provide updates across projects, and to support each other as we consider Cosmos governance.

### Next Call
Mid-month topic call - **Wed Mar 18 @ 15:00 UTC** - **Connecting Cosmos Hub's governance to a dedicated legal entity**

- [Calendar invite]()

**Context:** My understanding is that Zaki (Iqlusion) is working to establish a legal entity. This entity would be dedicated to orchestrating the kind of developer work that All in Bits has done in the past for the Cosmos Hub. The dev work would be funded by the community pool via the legal entity, which would then be accountable to the Cosmos Hub. 

**Plan** Zaki intends to provide an update after a discussion with the lawyer, and we can discuss the work that should be done on the Hub side to establish a connection with the legal entity.
