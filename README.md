## Cosmos GWG Community Call
Discuss community calls [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/gwg-community-calls-updates/3238/6)

### Purpose
The Cosmos GWG Community Call is intended to bring together various Cosmos stakeholders who play major roles developing the Cosmos Hub. It's the opportunity to connect, provide updates across projects, and to support each other as we consider Cosmos governance.

### Next Call
Mid-month topic call - **Wed Mar 18 @ 15:00 UTC** - **Connecting Cosmos Hub's governance to a dedicated legal entity**

- [Calendar invite](http://bit.ly/38SX13K)

**Context:** My understanding is that Zaki (Iqlusion) is working to establish a legal entity. This entity would be dedicated to orchestrating the kind of developer work that All in Bits has done in the past for the Cosmos Hub. The dev work would be funded by the community pool via the legal entity, which would then be accountable to the Cosmos Hub. 

**Agenda:** Single-sentence intros from newcomers. Gavin (Figment) to provide brief background. Zaki intends to provide an update after a discussion with the lawyer, and we can discuss the work that should be done on the Hub side to establish a connection with the legal entity.

**Chat:**
```
00:21:39	Gavin (Figment):	1. How do you fund work on an ongoing basis?
00:22:22	Gavin (Figment):	2. How do you incentivize people to do the managerial work? And how can that be a big opportunity for newcomers.
00:25:16	Gavin (Figment):	Documentation and best practices work funded, too (via same proposal)
00:25:19	Gavin (Figment):	https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki
00:25:23	Gavin (Figment):	https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend
00:26:42	zakimanian:	https://twitter.com/lex_node
00:26:51	Gavin (Figment):	Legal entity could be a middle management layer between Cosmos Hub governance mechanism and those who do development work.
00:29:20	Taariq Lewis:	So doesn’t this entity now be liable for the legal outcomes of the token holder’s desires?
00:31:08	Gavin (Figment):	A thing that gives legal rights to token-holders. This legal entity would be obligated to pursue their desires, as expressed through the governance mechanism. Rather than have many employees, the legal entity could have many company members.
00:32:18	Gavin (Figment):	15 mins remaining
00:41:06	Matthew Felice Pace:	How does this solve the problem of the cosmos hub deciding direction? Will direction be decided by this entity or by governance?
00:42:10	Gavin (Figment):	Hey Matthew, I think that the Hub decides direction, the entity holds accountable the participants that execute the decision.
00:42:36	Gavin (Figment):	The entity itself would be held accountable to the Hub.
00:43:29	Matthew Felice Pace:	so a middle man that distributes funds and makes sure that things are done?
00:43:31	Florian | Staking Facilities:	Have to jump onto another call, sadly. See you guys next time :wave:
00:44:07	Gavin (Figment):	Yes, I think so (Matthew). Take care, Florian, thanks for joining!
00:44:17	Stamford Hwang:	Kind of like the role of Department of Justice?
00:47:21	Gavin (Figment):	We’re at 45mins, gotta wrap it up.
00:52:24	Gavin (Figment):	Working group call afterparty, no pressure to stick around.
00:54:56	Gavin (Figment):	Add your name to this list (semi-public) and I can email you about future calls: http://bit.ly/2sukvxa
00:56:27	Ismail Khoffi:	Thanks everyone!
