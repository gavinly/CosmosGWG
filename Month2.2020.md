Duration: 60 minutes (was actually 50 minutes)

Video conference URL: https://zoom.us/j/350368377

## Agenda

#### 1. Newcomer introductions
Please keep intros brief! Ideally your name, organization, primary governance interest in a single sentence :)

#### 2. GWG updates
- mid-month topic call review (initial proposal intake process)
- update from Gavin (Figment Networks) re: documentation & best practices for [community-spend](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend) & [parameter-change](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki) proposals

#### 3. Proposed Topic: How can governance work be made sustainable?
There may be big players that can subsidize governance work:
- exchanges and uninvolved validators need to be alerted to breaking changes
- exchanges may need support to understand the implications of a proposal
- multi-asset wallets may need to be alerted to breaking changes

What is the low-hanging fruit for supporting governance work?

#### 4. Future planning
- What single topic is a current priority for the next mid-month call?
- Consider recommendations for GWG Q2 initiatives ie. what could a Q2 GWG community-spend proposal look like?

## Notes
The Zoom video link in the calendar invite failed, making it difficult for attendees to join. We started recording the call ten minutes late at 14:10 UTC and finished on time at 15:00 UTC.
