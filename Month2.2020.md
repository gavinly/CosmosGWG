[discuss here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/gwg-community-calls-updates/3238)

Date: Thursday, February 27

Time: 14:00 UTC

Duration: 60 minutes (was actually 50 minutes)

Host: Gavin Birch ([Figment Networks](figment.network))

Video conference URL: https://zoom.us/j/350368377

1. [Join us!](http://bit.ly/2sukvxa) Please share any contact information that you feel comfortable sharing.
2. Please indicate [your primary governance interests here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdSwln5L7KLvEkkM91GhlblniSynmAjMyAWSLONxTGQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Agenda

#### 1. Newcomer introductions
Please keep intros brief! Ideally your name, organization, primary governance interest in a single sentence :)

#### 2. GWG updates
- mid-month topic call review (initial proposal intake process)
- update from Gavin (Figment Networks) re: documentation & best practices for [community-spend](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend) & [parameter-change](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki) proposals

#### 3. Proposed Topic: How can governance work be made sustainable?
There may be big players that can subsidize governance work:
- exchanges and uninvolved validators need to be alerted to breaking changes
- exchanges may need support to understand the implications of a proposal
- multi-asset wallets may need to be alerted to breaking changes

What is the low-hanging fruit for supporting governance work?

#### 4. Future planning
- What single topic is a current priority for the next mid-month call?
- Consider recommendations for GWG Q2 initiatives ie. what could a Q2 GWG community-spend proposal look like?

## Notes
The Zoom video link in the calendar invite failed, making it difficult for attendees to join. We started recording the call ten minutes late at 14:10 UTC and finished on time at 15:00 UTC.
