[discuss here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/gwg-community-calls-updates/3238)

Date: Thursday, February 27

Time: 14:00 UTC

Duration: 60 minutes (was actually 50 minutes)

Host: Gavin Birch ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network))

Video conference URL: https://zoom.us/j/350368377

## Prior to the meeting
1. [Join us!](http://bit.ly/2sukvxa) Please share any contact information that you feel comfortable sharing.
2. Please indicate [your primary governance interests here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jdSwln5L7KLvEkkM91GhlblniSynmAjMyAWSLONxTGQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Agenda

#### 1. Newcomer introductions
Please keep intros brief! Ideally your name, organization, primary governance interest in a single sentence :)

#### 2. GWG updates
- mid-month topic call review (initial proposal intake process)
- update from Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network)) re: documentation & best practices for [community-spend](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosCommunitySpend) & [parameter-change](https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki) proposals

#### 3. Proposed Topic: How can governance work be made sustainable?
There may be big players that can subsidize governance work:
- exchanges and uninvolved validators need to be alerted to breaking changes
- exchanges may need support to understand the implications of a proposal
- multi-asset wallets may need to be alerted to breaking changes

What is the low-hanging fruit for supporting governance work?

#### 4. Future planning
- What single topic is a current priority for the next mid-month call?
- Consider recommendations for GWG Q2 initiatives ie. what could a Q2 GWG community-spend proposal look like?

## Notes
The Zoom video link in the calendar invite failed, making it difficult for attendees to join. We started recording the call ten minutes late at 14:10 UTC and finished on time at 15:00 UTC.

#### 2. GWG updates
##### Mid-month topic call review from Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network))
On Feb 13 we had a short call to discuss how the GWG should accept draft governance proposals in order to provide feedback. We decided that anyone with a late-stage proposal can engage on the forum, Telegram, Discord, Twitter, etc and as a group we can review their draft proposal. For proposals that we are prepared to provide support, we'll invite the proposer to the private Discord channel for fluid discussion and we'll provide feedback via Google Docs. 

##### Governance work updates from Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network))
On Feb 26, Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network)) published v1.0 of the Community-Spend Best Practices doc. The end-user can use these docs to make the proposal process easier. The GWG can use this to provide support for people drafting community-spend proposals. Gavin is looking for feedback as people use the docs to improve upon the docs. You can read more about that [here](https://figment.network/resources/cosmos-community-spend-best-practices/).

#### 3. How can governance work be made sustainable?
Zaki ([Iqlusion](https://www.iqlusion.io)) - What is governance work right now? How to resource three components: 1) the right institutions to interact with on-chain governance, 2) promoting governance & engaging with stakeholders and 3) interfacing users with governance. Zaki wants to work on a join-venture structure in order to address component #1. Other protocols are interested in a join venture legal structure. Meeting with a lawyer on Mar 16. The idea here is to fund a legal entity (via the community pool) to do the work that All in Bits has done to support Cosmos development.

Zaki ([Iqlusion](https://www.iqlusion.io)) - perhaps there should be a budget for the governance work involved in getting a proposal passed, eg. as part of community-spend proposals; ICF grants; etc.

Gregory ([Regen Network](https://www.regen.network)) - some sort of DAO with a budget from the community pool with reputable members that disburse funding.

Gavin ([Figment Networks](https://figment.network)) - There may be big players that can subsidize governance work:
- exchanges and uninvolved validators need to be alerted to breaking changes
- exchanges may need support to understand the implications of a proposal
- multi-asset wallets may need to be alerted to breaking changes

What is the low-hanging fruit for supporting governance work? Let's keep discussing how to fund governance work. We've also opened a new dimension of governance work: how can we get dev work done sustainably?

#### 4. Future planning
- Perhaps our mid-month single topic call could be about how the Cosmos governance mechanism could interface with a legal entity
- Rather than a Q2 GWG community-spend proposal, what kind of governance work could be proposed for funding in Q2?
